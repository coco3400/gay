> Based on scientific studies about facial characteristics of gays, the Internet Agency NETRO has created an online tool to verify your sexual orientation in under 10 seconds. NETRO wrote an algorithm to compare your face with the original databases from the studies of the Charles University in Prague and the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. In approximately 10 seconds a face is measured and analyzed and the sexual orientation can be determined. Gay Check Online is a rapid and simple method to provide the user with a sense of security and clarity.

You always wanted to know if you are gay? No problem, with Gay Online Check you easily can verify if you or your friends are gay or not. Our very special algorithm calculates the input data from your webcam and analyze your gay attitudes. After 5 seconds of tense waiting for the result the website will show your sexual orientation.
The project documentates the actual discussion about sexual orientation and it works with the deep fear of being gay in our society and how to manage the situation after the coming out. At the end our website analyze that every user is gay. 
Gay Online Check wants to show that the discussion about gay or not gay is totally needless and not contemporary.
